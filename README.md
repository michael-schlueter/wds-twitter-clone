# Twitter Clone
This project is a clone of the popular Twitter app. It includes all the basic functionality provided by Twitter.



## General Information
- I undertook this project to learn how to work with the T3 stack (NextJS, TailwindCSS, Prisma, tRPC, Typescript, NextAuth)
- Additionally I wanted to get to know how to implement authentication in a NextJS app using next-authentication
- I also wanted to solidify my knowledge in working with NextJS, this time using the pagesrouter instead of the new approuter.
- Plus I wanted to know how to deploy and manage a full-stack app like this on Vercel.



## Technologies Used
- React 18.2.0
- Next 13.4.2
- TypeScript 5.0.4
- Tailwind 3.3.0
- Prisma 4.14.0
- tRPC 10.26.0
- NextAuth 4.22.1
- Zod 3.21.4
- React Icons 4.10.1
- React-Infinite-Scroll 6.1.0



## Features
- Register and login using your Discord Account
- Create tweets
- Add / remove followers
- Read tweets from everyone or only your followers
- Like tweets

## Learnings
- Implementing authentication using NextAuth in combination with discord
- Creating and managing databases with PlanetScale
- Using the T3 stack in general and benefitting from the type-safety and auto-complete features
- Using NextJS to build a full-stack application and deploying it via Vercel
- Some technologies used in this tutorial (tRPC, NextJS, Zod) I'm not yet competent in. So a lot of the content went over my head a little bit
- Consuming tutorials like this is not the best way to learn about these new technolgies. I probably am not able to reproduce this app without any help
- Therefore I'll be focusing more on reading the documentation of these technologies and after that, revisiting this project to better understand the details and work myself on enhancing it



## Project Status
The project is finished in terms of the tutorial. I may revisit this project once I'm more comfortable using the technogies used in this project. There are several features of Twitter which aren't included yet such as editing Tweets, using Hashtags, Retweets, Bookmarks etc. It would be fun trying to enhance this project myself with these features once I feel capable doing so.
